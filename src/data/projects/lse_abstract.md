#### Abstract

> In this paper, I build on the work of Generic Machine Learning Inference, a Machine Learning(ML) approach to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects in RCTs. Through Monte Carlo simulation, I investigate the performance of the estimator under different data generating processes (DGPs) and demonstrate its ability to make valid inference under different settings. Specifically, I show that Generic ML - which requires no parametric assumption - is significantly more powerful than classic heterogeneity tests under functional form mis-specification, a plausible situation given that researchers do not generally have access to the true DGP. I also improve its implementation by re-proposing performance metrics that identify the best ML method. Applying Generic ML to an RCT of village-based schools in Afghanistan, I derive new insights and thus demonstrate the usefulness of this approach. Specifically, I find that treatment effects on school enrollment and test scores increase with age and distance to non village-based schools for girls. This proved particularly insightful as distance was raised as a potential explanation for heterogeneity but not formally analysed by the original researchers.
