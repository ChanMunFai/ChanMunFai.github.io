#### Abstract

> Long-term video prediction remains a highly challenging problem. The high dimensionality of pixels often warrants for highly complex models that are difficult and expensive to train. I build upon the work of the Kalman Variatonal Autoencoder [1] (KVAE), a highly efficient model that combines variational autoencoders (VAEs) with the Linear Gaussian State Space Model. In doing so, it is able to effectively disentangle an objectâ€™s representation from its dynamics. In this paper, I reformulate the Evidence Lower Bound of the KVAE to develop a hierarchy of latent variables for the KVAE. The hierarchical KVAE can outperform the KVAE on certain datasets and decompose latent dynamics according to its levels, enabling greater interpretability.
