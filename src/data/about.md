# Intro

I graduate with a BSc in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics(EME) degree at the London School of Economics(LSE) in July 2021. At the LSE, I took and audited multiple courses related to econometrics and statistics.

As an aspiring data scientist, I appreciate that my greatest gaps in knowledge and core competancies are in the field of computer science. Hence, I will enroll in the MSc Artificial Intelligence degree in Imperial in September 2021. Hopefully, this will give me the skills to complement my rather 'mathy' but not 'too technical' undergraduate degree.

I decided to create a personal website because
1. It is cool and I found this wonderful design off the Internet.
2. In an attempt to reduce my reliance on social media, I will be using Linkein less frequently and will use this platform to detail my personal projects and achievements instead.

# Currently

In summer 2021, these are the personal projects I wish to embark on.

- More documentation on code for Generic Machine Learning
- CSE 371 by Skiena
- Work through textbook for Mathematics for Machine Learning
