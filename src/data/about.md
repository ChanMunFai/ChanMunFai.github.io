# Intro

Hey! I am Mun Fai! Welcome to my website! I am a recent graduate from Imperial's MSc in Artificial Intelligence as well as LSE's BSC in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics. As a Public Service Commission Scholar with a background in tech and statistics, I like thinking about how tech and big data can improve welfare in society.
