# Intro

<p>Hey! I am from Singapore and I have been studying in the UK in the last 3 years. I am a Public Service Commission scholar and will serve in the public service for 6 years upon graduation.</p>

<p>I graduated with a BSc in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics(EME) at the London School of Economics(LSE) in July 2021. As an aspiring data scientist, I fopcused on multiple courses in econometrics and statistics. I will proceed to embark on a MSc Artificial Intelligence degree at Imperial College London in October 2021. </p>

# My journey into Data Science

<p> My stumbling into machine learning and tech has been rather accidental and self-directed, hence it will be cool to share a little bit about this. </p>

- I first learnt and even heard about data science in June 2018 where I had the privilege to enrol in iXperience Summer School in Cape Town, South Africa. Funny thing was that I had initially signed up for a full-stack coding course(with absolutely no idea what that meant!), did some HTML and Javascript pre-course assignments and did not understand the first 2 hours of my first class. Hence, my friend (who is incredibly smart as he hails from Harvard) and I dropped out into the supposedly easier Data Science class.

- Here, I realised the close similarity between data science and what I was learning back in school - Economics. The statistics component of it came easily to me as I was already used to this in school. I learnt fundamental programming skills in R and even had the chance to embark on a 4-week internship at Quicket which foucsed primarily on data visualisation.

- Going back to school in Autumn 2018, I focused heavily on the "theoretical" and more "mathy" sides of data science. I chose an intermediate fundamental statistics course ST202 as well as a near graduate level Econometrics course EC221. The latter course involved extensive usage of linear algebra to prove the Gauss-Markov assumptions for linear regression and provides a solid foundation into the applied usage of linear algebra. I attained high Firsts for both courses, and even attained the 3rd highest grade for EC221.

- My programming skills improved substantially in summer 2019. I spent months completing online Machine Learning courses, such as the Machine Learning and Deep Learning specialisations by Andrew Ng. Concurrently, I also enrolled in Fastai's course and this gave me much practical experience with regards to actual deep learning projects. For instance, I created an animal classifier that attained near state-of-the-art accuracy and rendered it on a website (though I have to eventually take it down after a first month free trial for the server). Apart from the ML and deep learning knowledge, I also gained much experience with deep learning libraies such as Tensorflow and Pytorch.

- I undertook a 3 month internship with the Singapore Department of Statistics. There, I finally appreciate the power of programming as being a tool to solve problems, including problems that were previously unsolved. I was tasked to research on the best way to generate synthetic data, an esoteric field with scarce literature yet growing importance in the real world. At first daunted by the dearth of information on this, I decided to create my own framework that systematically evaluates the quality of synthetic data - along the lines of accuracy and confidentiality. I painstakingly navigated through advanced mathematical research papers and coded various mathematical functions into R functions, before compiling them into an R package. Besides contributing to this literature, I discovered new ways to expedite the synthesis process from hours to just mere minutes without significantly compromising the quality of synthetic data.

- In my final year at the LSE, I decided to use my programming and ML skills for good as I sought to mentor and empower other like-minded individuals. I became the Head of Projects at LSE Data Science Society and single-handedly led and supervised 11 data science teams in both Michaelmas and Lent term. I also took on a paid job to become a coach for LSE Python for Economics week, a programme designed to develop Python skills for Economics undergraduates.
