One such method is the Kalman Variational AutoEncoder(KVAE) model. Without diving into technicalities, this model processes an object's appearance and movement separately. Hence, if the object looks largely the same throughout the video, being able to predict its movement is sufficient in predicting how it appears in future frames."}),(0,a.jsx)("p",{children:"I further improve this method by incorporating hierarchies in my model.
